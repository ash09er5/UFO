# UFO

#Overview
The purpose of this project was to build an application that can read through a dataset in the form of
javaScript and display it on an html page.

You minght be able to use this data set to determine ufo hotspots and if there is a corelation between where the sighting occur 
and how often that they happen. this was a good way to take a dataset and visulaize it. however one problem i had with it
was the filter table, i could not get the color change and be simlilar to the rest of the page. It may have been a problem with the bootstrap 
so i tried to do it without using bootstrap and just do it with regualr CSS.

i would have prefered to display the data a different way such as maybe with python and sql because i find javaScript a little confusing
and sometimes difficult to understand. But this was a good way to show data on an html page and make it dynamic by being able to display 
dataand filter through it
